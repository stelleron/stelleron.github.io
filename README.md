# Nullsite v2.0 - Now in Go!
Nullsite Go is a rehash of my original Nullsite static site generator written in Python, found [here](https://github.com/stelleron/nullsite/tree/main), though with improved features and style this time around. It's easy to use, simple, and minimalist (just like the original!).
## Usage
1. Download this repository via `git clone`
2. Add your blogposts as markdown files to the posts/ folder (all .md files have a frontmatter that must be included)
3. Run `main.go` to build the site
Look at the examples provided to understand how Nullsite works
You must provide your own server to host the `index.html`. I'd recommend using the Live Server extension on VSCode.
