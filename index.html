        <div class="index-post-date">11-09-2022</div>
        <p class="index-post-desc"> So as a bit of a break while I work on a final version of the Arcana2D framework, I created a simple painting app in Python and Pygame. Here's my breakdown of it.</p>

        <p class="index-post-desc"> For a bit of fun, I decided to make yet another Brainf**k interpret in Python. Here's a simple breakdown of the language and how the code works</p>

        <p class="index-post-desc"> It's been a long while since I've made a post here, and the framework's made some major progress. Here I'll be going through some of the new API changes, how the framework logs messages and renders sprites.</p>

        <div class="index-post-date">17-08-2022</div>
        <p class="index-post-desc"> In this blogpost, I talk about how the many options I considered for how to implement the engine's renderer to make drawing primitives quickly, and what I finally decided on for the implementation.</p>

        <p class="index-post-desc"> Designing a game framework isn't easy, and I can tell from experience. I'm going to talk about my old and now discontinued game framework Glimmer2D, why I redesigned it, and how my new game framework works.</p>
