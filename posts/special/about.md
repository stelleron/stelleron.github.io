# About Me
Hello! I'm currently a high school senior who just likes to code as a hobby, and hopefully in the future, as a professional job! I'm pretty experienced with programming languages such as Lua, Python and C++, while also having a bit of experience with Rust and Haxe. My main interests in coding is just web dev, game dev and studying programming languages!
