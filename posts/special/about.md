# About Me
Hello! My name is Shreyas Donti, and I'm currently a freshman student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst currently pursuing a Computer Science and Electrical Engineering double major! I'm an avid programmer who mainly programs in C++ and Python, with experience in C, Java, JavaScript, Rust, Go, Lua, and Haxe. My main interests currently lie in graphics programming and software development, though I'm looking to learn about computer architecture, operating systems, compilers, chip design, and many more of the near infinite fields in computers. Nice to meet you!
