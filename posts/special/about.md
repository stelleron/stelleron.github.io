# About Me
Hello 👋 👋 👋 ! My name is Shreyas Donti, and I'm a junior Honors student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst pursuing a double major in Computer Science & Electrical Engineering. Nice to meet you!

I'm interested in everything tech - from video game development to programming languages - to hardware and machine learning. If it's tech, I want to learn more! My primary interests within CS are low-level and embedded systems software, and within EE I'm hugely passionate about working with electronics and FPGAs! I love working at the intersection of the two as well in the field of robotics!

## My Interests
- 🤖 **Embedded Systems & Robotics**: working with real-time automated systems, IoT.
- 💻 **Software Development**: compilers, firmware, software for design & development.
- ⚡ **Electronics**: PCB design, circuit testing and design.
- ⚙️ **FPGA Programming**: FPGA engineering for ML model acceleration.

## My Experiences
- 🎓 **Undergraduate Course Assistant** for UMass' CS 230 course on Computer Systems Principles.
- 🛠️ **Tech Team Organizer** for HackUMass XII and XIII (upcoming).
- 🤖 **Electronics Team Member** of UMass American Society of Mechanical Engineers Student Design Competition 2024-2025.
- ⚙️ **FPGA Engineer** for UMass Cubesat Onboard Processing sub-team.
- 🧪 **Undergradaute Research Volunteer (URV)** program cohort of Summer 2024, where I designed a 1-D CNN model of identifying postural transitions and other human activities using PyTorch.
