<p>So I&rsquo;m currently working on a game engine kinda similar to Love2D, but using the Wren scripting language to expose the API instead. To make the design easy, I split the engine into a frontend and a backend. The backend implement the features of a game engine like windowing, rendering and input handling, whereas the frontend would help it interface with the Wren API. I initially designed the two together, but then I realised I could design the backend seperately as a seperate game framework and wrap it with the Wren frontend in the game engine.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s how Glimmer2D was born! Since I&rsquo;d mostly worked around with the Raylib games library( a super-underrated game library that you should totally check <a href="https://www.raylib.com/index.html" target="_blank">out</a>), I used it as my inspiration for the API.</p>

<p>Raylib&rsquo;s API, in my opinion, is amazing for beginner developers with its usage of the pleasant-to-read Pascal case and its comfortable naming conventions that simply tell you what a function does or the purpose of a given struct is, especially in comparision to other game libraries written in the C programming language. Something like <code>Font</code> or <code>GetFPS()</code> is a lot more readable than something like <code>sapp_sgcontext()</code>, which, while is from the wonderful Sokol game library, still looks a lot more daunting to an amateur programmer.</p>

<p>Anyway, coming back to my game framework, I not only based my API on Raylib&rsquo;s, but also ended up learning a lot from its code when it came to game engine design. However, I found myself aping too much from Raylib&rsquo;s API, to the point it just felt kinda like a C++ binding for Raylib, so it ended up feeling like a bit of a pointless creation. That wasn&rsquo;t what discouraged me from finishing the framework though, it was the endless bugs I ran into when designing the rendering, stuff that I wouldn&rsquo;t solve until I swapped to working on my new framework, Arcana2D, where I decided to start on working on the renderer instead, since that&rsquo;s the beefiest and most difficult part of the engine.</p>

<h1 id="arcana2d-how-it-works">Arcana2D - how it works</h1>

<p>Arcana2D is my newer version of the game framework with an entirely different API, and I ended up liking the API a bit more. I took a bit of inspiration from game engines like Sokol and Bevy where instead of running the game in the <code>main()</code> function, it instead passes control to an <code>App</code> object that the user configures, sets an <code>init()</code>, <code>update()</code>, <code>render()</code> and <code>finish()</code> function so the app can automatically run them, passing down arguments for the user to interface with the engine&rsquo;s API while maintaining privacy. Each function passes down different data, and serves a different purpose.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>init()</code> passes down an <code>AppConfig</code> so that the user can set details such as window size, background color, while also initialising/setting whatever data they want. A <code>UserData</code> object is used to store a void pointer to an object that stores of all of the game&rsquo;s relevant data that has to be shared by multiple functions, hence removing the need for global variables. All functions pass the <code>UserData</code> argument.</p></li>

<li><p><code>update()</code> passes down a <code>GameContext</code> object that stores relevant information such as inputs buffered and delta time between frames. By controlling what data is passed down to the <code>update()</code> function, I can prevent draw commands from happening during the update phase of the game engine, so that the renderer and window can be prepared. The <code>update()</code> function just serves to update the game logic based on tabulated inputs and such, so that&rsquo;s why I wanted to seperate rendering from it.</p></li>

<li><p><code>render()</code> passes down a <code>RenderContext</code> that simply allows the user to draw objects to the screen. How the renderer works and how I came to the decision of how I should implement it is something I look forward to discussing in a later blogpost.</p></li>

<li><p><code>finish()</code> is just called when the game is closed, and only passes down  <code>UserData</code>. All of the game engine&rsquo;s data is automatically removed by the <code>App</code>&rsquo;s destructor, so it just exists to do stuff like saving data and freeing user-allocated objects.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The structure of the framework is a lot more different from my initial version of it, but I am fond of it&rsquo;s design. It feels very contained and organised, and makes for a bit less of a hassle to code certain features with it, such as calculating delta time and capping frame rates. Well, hopefully I can finish up with this quickly so I can proceed to getting back to designing the Wren interface for my <strong>ACTUAL</strong> game engine. Until then, see you next time!</p>
