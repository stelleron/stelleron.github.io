<p>As the title and description says, this is my first ever post on this blog! However, this isn&rsquo;t the first time I&rsquo;ve ever created a blog. Earlier this year, I created a blog using Jekyll Now during March to document my progress on my game engine and explore my design decisions. However, I found myself with a few problems during the making of the blog:
<br>
<br></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Updating way too inconsistently</strong>: I only had three posts on the blog, and I made each post after a month&rsquo;s time. Since I was bogged down with schoolwork and exams and all of the pains and suffering of being a high schooler, I couldn&rsquo;t really make much time for this blog. Besides, when I did have some spare time, I would devote it to improving the game engine, segueing into my next problem:</li>
<li><strong>Game Engine development progressed faster than I could blog about it</strong>: Even though I had only three posts about my game engine&rsquo;s progress, I&rsquo;d made many more leaps and bounds in the engine&rsquo;s development. In my second post I detailed how I setting up the basic framework for my engine. At that exact same point in time, I was working on extension loading and creating a Shader class for the engine.
I wanted to be able to track my development step by step, but I was running way too fast for that. I ended up losing track of what concept I should blog about next since I would have finished implementing it long ago and have forgotten about it soon after.</li>
<li><strong>I didn&rsquo;t like using Jekyll Now</strong>: This is more of a personal preference issue, since I just didn&rsquo;t link how Jekyll Now looked. Granted, it&rsquo;s an incredible tool and it made making blogs super convenient, but I just disliked how the font looked. Furthermore, I was struggling to get Jekyll installed on my Mac since the system&rsquo;s version of Ruby sucks and I kept getting errors saying that I didn&rsquo;t have permission access to download it. This meant that if I wanted to preview Jekyll&rsquo;s changes, I had to preview it after pushing my changes to my GitHub repo, and those changes could take many minutes to load.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
So, sometime during May, I took my blog down and flushed all evidence of it&rsquo;s existence down the toilet. But then come July and with a lot more free time now that I wasn&rsquo;t being anchored down by exams, I decided to reinstate my blog. However, I decided not to use Jekyll Now this time. I ended up looking into other options.</p>

<h2 id="creating-my-second-blog">Creating my second blog</h2>

<p>First, I looked into Zola, since I liked the Hyde theme ported from Jekyll, and since I was struggling with getting Jekyll installed, I went for the next option. But I kept struggling with using Zola and loading in the Hyde theme, so I eventually ditched it out of impatience. I eventually figured out how to install Jekyll via using another version of Ruby instead of the system version, but I came to realise how outdated Hyde was, and that it was incompatiable with recent versions of Jekyll. I eventually gave up with using external static site generators, and created one of my own.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-made-nullsite">How I made Nullsite</h2>

<p>I first tried to create Nullsite with Rust since most of what resources I looked into to learn how to create my own static site generator were in Rust, but I eventually swapped to Python for convenience. It had been over a whole year since I&rsquo;d touched Python, and I must say, coming back to Python after using C++ feels like a breath of fresh air. The ease of usage and zero compile times, not needing to type in <code>#includes</code> everywhere and setup a project with Premake, shell files and all of my libraries made the developer experience so much more enjoyable. Oh, how I&rsquo;ve missed you Python.</p>

<p>The idea is simple - the Python file simply just looks at a provided config.toml file to find some important details, then loads all of the required Markdown files, converts it into HTML and injects it into a given template and saves it to create a blogpost. The information from all of the blogposts is saved and used to generate the index, which also sorts all of the blogposts by date.</p>

<p>Also note that each Markdown blogpost comes with a YAML Frontmatter, which is essentially the stuff at the beginning of each Markdown file between the two lines made up of <code>=</code> symbols. This just contains all of the metadata, which includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Title of the blogpost</li>
<li>Date of publishing</li>
<li>A basic description</li>
</ul>

<p>The end result of Nullsite is slightly janky since I made it in a day, and it does use tons of global variables and repeated code blocks, but it works, so I don&rsquo;t really mind. It&rsquo;ll probably be a pain to add anything new to it though.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still happy with the end result, which you can check in the <a href="/site/projects.html">Projects</a> tab.</p>

<h2 id="signing-off">Signing off</h2>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m looking forward to start blogging again properly. My dev logs aren&rsquo;t necessarily gonna be tracking any of my projects, but rather just exploring stuff I&rsquo;ve learned or stuff I&rsquo;ve done in my projects, and I&rsquo;ll try to keep new blogposts with two weeks of each other at the very most. Now, time for me to get back to work!</p>
