<h1>My Projects</h1>
<h2>Datapak</h2>
<p>Datapak is a C++ library that is designed with simplicity in mind to package and compress files into a single .datapak file (file extension can be renamed). Datapak uses the DEFLATE algorithm to compress data and requires only the datapak.hpp and datapak.cpp files along with the DEFLATE headers.</p>

<h2>Datapak CLI</h2>
<p>Datapak CLI is a command-line interface for creating, packaging, modifying and extracting .datapak files. It's easy to use, has multiple commands for modifying Datapaks which ever way you wish, and minimalist.</p>

<h2>Nullsite</h2>
<p>Nullsite is the technology used to make this blog. With an implementation in Python at around 155 lines of code, it's a tiny and simple static site generator that allows you to create blogs with ease! It's small size makes it easy to customise and use in any way you want!</p>

<h2>Glimmer2D</h2>
<p>Glimmer2D is a game library written in C++ using GLFW/GLAD, with an API inspired by Raylib. It offers a lightweight implementation with a minimal and easy to navigate library to get started with 2D games development. Glimmer2D is currently being developed as a low level library to be used alongside the MAGE Engine.</p>

<h2>MAGE Engine</h2>
<p>The MAGE Engine is a game engine inspired by the LÃ–VE2D Game Engine to help <strong>M</strong>ake <strong>A</strong>wesome <strong>G</strong>ames <strong>E</strong>asy! Built on top of the handwritten OpenGL-based library, the Glimmer2D framework, MAGE uses the amazing Wren scripting language to provide a convenient API to make for a comfortable game design experience.</p>
